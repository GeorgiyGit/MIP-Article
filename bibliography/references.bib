abstract="Big data analysis is a modern and advanced means of data analysis, which can be used to achieve a more efficient and high-quality Internet information processing technology system. Therefore, relevant research will be carried out in this paper. This paper mainly discusses the basic concept of big data analysis and the relationship between it and Internet information processing, and then puts forward the design scheme of Internet information processing technology system according to the idea of big data analysis. Through research, the Internet information processing technology system based on big data analysis has obvious advantages in processing efficiency and performance, and has certain application value.",

abstract="This paper deals with a comparative analysis between Collaborative Filtering (CF), Content Based Filtering (CB) and Sentiment Analysis to build a recommendation Engine using Spotify Dataset. Using playlist-song association as an implicit feedback for a user, we implemented CF and we applied the Content Based Filtering using song metadata from spotify dataset. Using lyrics from the dataset, we developed a sentiment analysis model, labeled the song to create a novel dataset and use it to suggest songs based on the mood. K performs better for a smaller value of K, but CF improves as K increases. CF improves as K is increased while K works better for a lower value of K. By comparing all results, TF-IDF outperforms SVM and NB in sentiment analysis.",

We developed multiple variants of proposed hybrid recommendation system architecture and compared their performance with a metric called hit rate. Furthermore, we discussed about data preparation and mathematical explanation of the machine learning models we used for hybrid recommendation system. To achieve this we used different python frameworks used for natural language processing and recommendation systems.",
