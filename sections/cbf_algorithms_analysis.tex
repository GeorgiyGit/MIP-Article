\subsection{Dataset description} % TODO
The analysis will be conducted on Book Crossing dataset collected by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler and edited by Arthur Forte \cite{Dataset}. The dataset contains 272,679 interactions from 2,946 users on 17,384 books. The users with less than 10 interactions were deleted from the original dataset by Arthur Forte, therefore there are no users with small amount of iterations.
