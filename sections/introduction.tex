\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Nowadays, internet resources are overfilled with large amounts of information, within which the user needs to be provided with relevant data to his interests. Without the help of the environment, users could not analyze this mass of information, which reduces the amount of processed data\cite{InternetBigData}.

Recommendation algorithms become a solution to this problem, because they make it possible to select individual content for each user, depending on their actions or the actions of other users. This approach improves the quality of information provided to the user making it more relevant to user preferences\cite{InternetBigData}.

Recommendation systems are used in the majority of social networks. Youtube uses different algorithms to recommend content that best matches users' preferences. Linkedin provides flexible jobs searching, Netflix suggests movies based on previous user actions\cite{CBF_In_Social_Networks}.
